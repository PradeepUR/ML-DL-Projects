MULTIPLE PROJECTS on ML & DL
Here I have mentioned the ML projects that I have worked on. I have attached all the codes and the dataset in the repository.

Applying ANN(Artificial Neural Networks) model to predict if the customer leave the bank the bank or not(Churn Modeling).

Applying CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) model to predict if the given image is a cat or dog.

Applying NLP(Natural Language Processing) on restaurant reviews to predict if it is a review is positive or negative.

Applying (Reinforcement Learning)Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound to optimize the marketing of advertisements.

Applying (Association Rule Learning)Apriori & Eclat algorithms to predict which item will be frequently bought with which item.

Applying (Clustering Algorithms)K-Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering to cluster the mall customers and their spending scores.

Applying (Classification Algorithms)Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest to predict if a item is purchased or not based on salary and age.

Applying (Regression Algorithms)SLR, MLR, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Regressor to predict the salary based on their level(position).
